# wscan+ Required Secrets

All secrets must be configured in GitHub repository settings before CI/CD can run end-to-end.
**Never commit actual values.** This file lists secret names and purpose only.

---

## Android Signing

| Secret Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE` | Base64-encoded release keystore file (`.jks` or `.keystore`) |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Alias of the signing key within the keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the signing key |
| `ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the keystore itself |

**Status:** ✅ All 4 secrets configured in GitHub (2026-03-15).
Keystore file: stored locally outside the repo in a dedicated keystore directory (not committed). Back up securely.
Generated via keytool (RSA 4096, validity 10000 days). Keep this file backed up securely.

**Rotation:** Rotate freely before any Play Store submission. After first submission, the upload key is tied to the app — replacing it requires Google Play App Signing enrollment and a key upgrade request. Do not rotate post-submission without a tracked plan.

To encode keystore for CI:
```bash
# Linux (GNU coreutils base64)
base64 -w 0 release.keystore > keystore.b64

# macOS / BSD base64
base64 -b 0 release.keystore > keystore.b64

# Then paste contents of keystore.b64 as the ANDROID_KEYSTORE secret value
```

## Google APIs (Android App)

| Secret Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Maps SDK for Android — scan history map, network heatmap |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_SIGNING_SECRET` | URL signing secret for server-side Maps API requests (without it: 25k/day unsigned cap) |
| `VERTEX_AI_API_KEY` | Vertex AI / Gemini — in-app threat analysis and AI heuristics. Key is bound to a service account; access is controlled by that account's IAM permissions. |

**Status:** ✅ All 3 secrets configured in GitHub (2026-03-15).
Rotation schedule: weekly pre-release, TBD post-release. Pre-release: consolidate service accounts and add per-key API restrictions.

## Local Development

For local Android builds, add to `android/local.properties` (git-ignored):
```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
VERTEX_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password
ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD=your_password
```

For local desktop builds, add to `.env` (git-ignored):
```
# See .env.example for all required variables
```

---

*Never commit `local.properties`, `.env`, keystore files, or any file containing actual secret values.*
