# wscan+ Reference Repositories

Reference projects used to inform wscanplus architecture, features, code quality, and detection logic.
Agents should study these before implementing related features.

## ⭐ Gold Standard

| Repo | URL | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| TrafficDetector | https://github.com/rajkunamaneni/TrafficDetector | Primary code quality and architecture bar. Python + Snort + tshark + Nmap on RPi. Detects MITM/eavesdropping, delivers plain-language alerts. Clean, well-structured code. Study before writing any detection logic. |

## ⭐ Critical Android Companion Reference

| Repo | URL | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| wigle-wifi-wardriving | https://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving | Primary feature reference for the Android companion app. Covers scan history, network mapping, signal strength visualization, background scanning, and data export — all features wscanplus must implement. NOTE: WiGLE as a cloud service is not used; the Android app UX and feature set is the reference. |
