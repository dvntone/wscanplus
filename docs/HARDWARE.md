# wscanplus Hardware Reference

This document describes the hardware available for development and testing of wscanplus. All attack scenarios are simulated in a controlled, private lab environment for the sole purpose of building and validating defensive detection capabilities.

## 📡 Wireless Adapters

| Adapter | Chipset | Monitor Mode | Packet Injection | Best Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Panda PAU0B** | Realtek (AC600) | ✅ Linux | ✅ Linux | RPi 5 passive scanning |
| **Alfa AWUS036ACS** | RTL8811AU | ✅ Linux | ✅ Linux | Primary attack simulation adapter |

> Both adapters work best on native Linux. Android monitor mode requires custom kernel — not reliable for current phases.
> On LG Gram (WSL2): requires `usbipd-win` for USB passthrough. RPi 5 is the preferred node for adapter work.

## 📱 Mobile Devices

| Device | Role |
|--------|------|
| **OnePlus 10T** | Primary Android app dev + test device |
| **Pixel 10 Pro XL** | High-end test target, latest Android |
| **Motorola G4 Play 2024** | Low-end test target, budget Android |
| **Revvl Tab 2** | Tablet UI testing |

## 💻 Compute

| Device | Boot Options | Use |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **LG Gram 15 (15Z)** | Windows 11 Insiders (primary) + WSL2 Kali + Live USB Kali/ParrotOS | Electron desktop dev, Kali tooling, full native Linux via live USB when needed |
| **Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)** | Kali Linux (microSD 1) + Ubuntu (microSD 2) | Dedicated monitor node, attack simulator lab, swap cards as needed |

> RPi 5 8GB has plenty of headroom to run Kismet, Wireshark, and wscanplus simultaneously.

## 🌐 Network Hardware

| Device | Type | Capabilities | Role |
|--------|------|-------------|------|
| **GL.iNet GL-MT300N (Mango)** | OpenWRT travel router, 2.4GHz, 300Mbps | VPN, repeater, captive portal, OpenWRT packages | Rogue AP simulation, captive portal testing |
| **GL.iNet Shadow (dual antenna)** | OpenWRT router, dual band | Evil twin setup, MITM lab, full OpenWRT | Primary network attack lab |

> Both GL.iNet devices run OpenWRT — ideal for simulating the exact attacks wscanplus is built to detect.

## 🐬 Flipper Zero

| Device | Firmware | Module | Capabilities |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Flipper Zero** | Momentum | WiFi Dev Board (Marauder) | Evil twin, deauth flood, beacon spam, probe sniffing, PMKID capture, passive scanning, BLE |

### Marauder → wscanplus Detection Mapping

| Marauder Attack | wscanplus Detection Target |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Deauth flood | Deauth storm alert |
| Evil twin / AP clone | Rogue AP detection |
| Beacon spam | Fake network flood detection |
| Probe sniffing | Passive recon detection |
| PMKID capture | WPA handshake grab alert |

## ⚠️ Usage Policy

All hardware listed here is used exclusively for:
- Testing and validating wscanplus detection capabilities
- Simulating attacks in a private, controlled lab environment
- Personal defense research — understanding attacks in order to detect and alert on them

No hardware or techniques documented here are used offensively or against networks/devices without explicit authorization.
